Paper Title:
Does implementing basic computer programming skills into the senior level Algebra 3-4 curriculum increase creativity and problem solving ability while also improving participation and performance of the students in the class?


Abstract:
The study was conducted to determine if introducing computer markup and programming skills to high school seniors changed the students' participation, attitude, and interest in math, thus leading to a higher performance, as measured by their grades in the course.  By implementing immediate applications through technology to concepts learned in Algebra 3-4, the students in this study, all of whom are below grade level in math, answered the over-asked question, "When am I ever going to use this?" by building their own websites and applications.  The students were guided with a blended approach of class lectures and their use of Codecademy, a free online coding program, which has built in tutorials, projects, and resources to assist the students in their learning.  Through this process, students learned more about, and improved their problem solving, logical reasoning, and creativity, that was involved in the algebra they learned.  This created a more positive outlook from the students regarding the importance of math in their daily lives, which led to a higher participation rate in class and ultimately a higher grade for the students in the course.
